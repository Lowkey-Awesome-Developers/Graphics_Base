# Unity Prototype:

The prototype consists of movement around the board. The player will move up to 6 spaces around the board.

The prototype gives a visualisation of how the 3d version of the game may look. It uses 3d models and a board compromised of multible objects each representing a different square.

When the application is run, the space bar is used to move. There are also temporary images to represent different parts of the board.

The movement uses a wrap around. Once at the final index, it will loop around to the starting indeces.
